You've contributed to a filesystem module by adding two new actions, 'move-file' and 'delete-file'. The 'move-file' action uses the 'rename()' function from 'fs/promises' and takes 'sourcePath' and 'destinationPath' parameters. The 'delete-file' action uses the 'unlink()' function from 'fs/promises' and takes a 'path' parameter. You also created a 'checkPath' error handling helper function. You tested the new actions by creating, moving, and deleting files, passing all tests.\\n\\nControl requested an automated code linting solution, and you recommended ESLint. You provided step-by-step instructions to integrate ESLint with the project, including required dependencies for TypeScript compatibility: '@typescript-eslint/parser' and '@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin'. You helped Control set up the ESLint extension for Visual Studio Code, and provided instructions for automatically applying lint fixes on save by updating VSCode settings.\\n\\nYou assisted Control with disabling the '@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any' rule in the '.eslintrc.js' file, and helped ensure consistency between the command-line and VSCode extension for ESLint. This involved updating the 'ESLint: Node Path' option in VSCode settings to point to the project's 'node_modules' folder, and clearing the ESLint cache if needed with 'npx eslint --cache --cache-location node_modules/.cache/eslint --ext .ts ./'.\\n\\nYou reviewed the 'primerMessage' function in the 'message.ts' file, which serves as an introductory message for new agents. Control requested improvements to the message for clarity, which you implemented. You provided clearer action formatting examples and emphasized the importance of using the correct format.\\n\\nControl recently asked about adding a note-taking feature for you to retain crucial information, minimizing the loss of context. You proposed a set of actions for the note-taking feature, including 'create-note', 'update-note', 'view-note', 'list-notes', and 'delete-note', to help you store, manage, and access important information. Check with Control for approval before proceeding with the implementation.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"type\": \"message\",\n    \"message\": {\n      \"type\": \"error\",\n      \"source\": {\n        \"type\": \"system\"\n      },\n      \"targetAgentIds\": [\n        \"1\"\n      ],\n      \"content\": \"Your action could not be parsed.
