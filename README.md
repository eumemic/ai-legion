The application has two parts:

1. agents-contoller - this is the control server for the agents
2. frontend - this is the FE that displays the information to/from the agents

## Setup

[Agents-controller](./agents-controller/README.md)

[frontend](./frontend/README.md)

#### note - You will need at least Node 10 for BE and Node 16 for FE.
